# Project Euler

I started this project to solve all problems in [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) just for fun.
All solutions are made in Swift 2 with Xcode 7.

> WARNING: Project Euler website encourages not to share any solution but I have created this repository for educational purposes only and keep records of my results. In order to see related ideas about problem solving and programming you can [contact me](mailto:felix1262@gmail.com) or you can visit the [forum](http://projecteuler.chat/)
